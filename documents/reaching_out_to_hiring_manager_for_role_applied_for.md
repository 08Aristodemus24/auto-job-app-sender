# If you have a connection in the inside:
Hello Cyrene I wasn't sure if this message would be timely, and I noticed you were my connection too, so I thought why not reach out to you personally.

But I am reaching out personally to express very much my interest in the recent opening for a <roles> role at <company>. 

In all honesty I've been intent since 1.5 years ago and all the more ever since graduating creating personal projects and posting about topics related to it on LinkedIn, but I know discussing my qualifications can't fit on a mere screen, so if it makes sense to talk I've already applied directly, and so I'd greatly appreciate any feedback and a timely response from you all.

Thank you and warm regards, 

Funnily enough I was actually already interviewed by perhaps your colleagues Sir Rey Luar and Sir Ryan Molina and passed for supposedly a contractual MLOps role by another agency but sadly wasn't pushed through, so I'm happy to look and apply for new opportunities, perhaps here directly for a similar role, as per Sir Rey's kind advices(Edited)

Hi Mark perhaps my message of mine might be timely but I thought I'd reach out and let you know I'm very much interested in the open <role> position at <company> which you <`reposted through your colleague Jienelle` or posted in your profile>. I've been posting a lot about data analytics and engineering and setting my profile in being more open to work opportunities so I thought I'd shoot my shot in applying and being considered as a candidate.

I know the discussion about qualifications can't fit in mere messages on a screen so if it makes sense to talk about it let me know and I'd love to discuss it with you. I've already sent <you or Jienelle> my CV via email so I appreciate any feedback and the timely response from you all. 

Thank you and warm regards, 

Larry
