# If you have a connection in the inside:
Hello Cyrene I wasn't sure if this message would be timely, and I noticed you were my connection too, so I thought why not reach out to you personally.

But I am reaching out personally to express very much my interest in the recent opening for a <roles> role at <company>. 

In all honesty I've been intent since 1.5 years ago and all the more ever since graduating creating personal projects and posting about topics related to it on LinkedIn, but I know discussing my qualifications can't fit on a mere screen, so if it makes sense to talk I've already applied directly, and so I'd greatly appreciate any feedback and a timely response from you all.

Thank you and warm regards, 

Funnily enough I was actually already interviewed by perhaps your colleagues Sir Rey Luar and Sir Ryan Molina and passed for supposedly a contractual MLOps role by another agency but sadly wasn't pushed through, so I'm happy to look and apply for new opportunities, perhaps here directly for a similar role, as per Sir Rey's kind advices(Edited)

Hi Mark perhaps my message of mine might be timely but I thought I'd reach out and let you know I'm very much interested in the open <role> position at <company> which you <`reposted through your colleague Jienelle` or posted in your profile>. I've been posting a lot about data analytics and engineering and setting my profile in being more open to work opportunities so I thought I'd shoot my shot in applying and being considered as a candidate.

I know the discussion about qualifications can't fit in mere messages on a screen so if it makes sense to talk about it let me know and I'd love to discuss it with you. I've already sent <you or Jienelle> my CV via email so I appreciate any feedback and the timely response from you all. 

Thank you and warm regards, 

Larry

Hi, Joan

I saw that you were for recruiting for an Azure Data Engineer, and I was quite excited to see the detailed descriptions you posted on the role. As it appears it's still open and I thought it wise to send this message directly to you to tell you more about how I fit perfectly for this role:

1. My recent project involved an end to end MLOps pipeline for a voice based machine learning model API where leveraging tools like Azure Functions, Azure Data Factory, and Azure Data Lake allowed me to extract, transform, and load 20gb/3.7billion data points of audio recordings from individuals to use for predicting their gender potentially for use in better derivation of insights in product/market analytics.
2. Another project involved me in building an end to end ETL pipeline for healtcare analytics revolving around chronic disease utilizing PowerBI and open source data warehousing solutions to manage costs and to identify KPIs that drove high rates of chronic disease in the US.
3. I'm proficient in various data analytics/engineering and especially tools which allowed me to build these projects, allowing me to gain experience in being able to not only maintain cloud infrastructure but also combine with open source tools for cost efficiency in terms of performance and storage 

While I have no doubt there are plenty of qualified applicants for this role, I think I possess the right skills that strike a balance in being able to optimize costs in terms of performance and storage AND being able to build as well scalable data solutions (without making your pockets hurt). So if it makes sense to talk further about my qualifications about this opportunity, I'd be thrilled if I can speak to you or anyone in your organization for this role.

Thank you and warm regards,

Larry
