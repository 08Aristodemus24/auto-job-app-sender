- I currently had experience with RAG agetns at my current internship
- salina is cool, this ml can take in fiels and interpet it
transcription using whisper X from audio/video, speech to text AI, can chapterize and summarize submitted video/audio

they'll list the technologies they use, some of it you have experience and some of it you won't list those as your strengths and weaknesses
strengths:
python
web scraping
node.js
in db management usually download mo yung management system like mongo db compass for mongo db, pgadmin 4 for postgresql, or mysql workbench for mysql, add to path the bin folder for accessible commands in command line, create instance in cloud or management system application itself and then save the insances credentials this will be the URI you will need with hostname and password you will need to connect to the instance, then we connect to the db via this instance

weaknesses:
redis 
etl
apache airflow
aws
azure
docker/containerization
separate my code based on functionality like django with apps, urls, settings
basically I should've separated the UI from the insertion of the reading of data and insertion of said data to db
use try catch block for potential errors in database transactions
try to write utilities.py that contains all helper functions
replace index.py with a more udnerstandable one where the name of the file represents what happens in the source code itself
naubusan lang ako oras pero important rin may comments, lagyan ng type ang mga arguments

employer will describe their worflow:
automatic web scraper, SQL, 
orchestrate

## Final interview might consist of the common...

### Why do you want to work here?
I think the idea of collecting and operating on large swathes of data
and using data from news articles, technological trends, medical data to allow other clients
to make their own decisions based on the data we could process for them really caught my eye
because in all honesty I'm just someone who's fond of doing so and i think doing it on the job will be a
great learning experience 

### Why should we hire you?
In all humility apart from obvious skills, I draw from my personal experience of quite frankly being always a lone developer
if there is such a term, and if I'm given the opportunity here to collaborate with a team of like minded individuals someone as wanting to grow just as much as me, and wanting to contribute just as much as me, I'll be driven to do my best to give back to this organization by doing my due diligence to always committing to the tasks at hand 

### Describing their workflow:
* ung meron naman impediments like yung siguro nahihirapan sa tasks ganun kilangan iresolve kasi every week dapat may milestone na natatapos
* they use agile methodology to develop applications, scrum to be specific. 2 - 4 weeks sprints. After these 2 or 4 weeks may natatapos na na feature ng application or nakapagpush na sa dev then into production branch. As a result some tools you really need to learn are docker for containerization, pulling from development branch and then merging in this branch
* product backlog - list of tasks for all sprints
* sprint backlog - specific tasks in the product backlog for a specific sprint lasting 1 to 4 weeks. E.g. for week 1 these are the tasks
* after completing tasks in the sprint after say 1 week there will be a presentation of your work to your colleagues

I was/am a data engineer intern at my previous company virtuals protocol where I've mainly used python as a programming language and libraries like pandas, numpy, tesseract, to clean and preprocess datasets for RAG AI agents or retrieval augmented generation AI agents. These preprocessed datasets coming from raw ones like pdfs, images, spreadsheets, jsons, word documents are then ingested by the AI agent to fine tune its knowledge base. This helps increase its market capital as an agent operating in environments like twitter in a purely automated fashion to engage users and have those users invest in it thus increasing capital.

my background is computer science where I've been for the last 6 years of my study learning all that I can about machine learning and deep learning and artificial intelligence using primarily python as a language and vast frameworks made for ML/AI like tensorflow, pytorch, numpy, pandas to build many of the projects I have revolving around AI/ML and more recently Data Engineering/ETL pipelines for seamless AI/ML model training.

[describe one of your personal projects or more accurately your dissertation which focuses on identifying noise/interferences in electrodermal activity signals recorded from human beings, this is to remove eventually these interferences and be able to use the cleaned signals for various medical tasks like stress detection or arousal detection]

This was the main specialization I chose given not only the rising trend with it but also by virtue of it capturing my interest because I thought AI could be healthcare one of my main shall we say advocacies that I'd like to partake in in the future/

in between my junior and senior year and even after I built more of the aforementioned personal projects and sought internships that honed my skills further in data preprocessing, data cleaning. One of my colleagues who I'd consider a prominent figure in the Philippine AI/ML tech space is theo ne that recruited me to the data engineerign role I interned for (Armielyn Obinguar).

* what do you do to manage stress?
I go outside, exercise and just try not to think about my work for a menial 1 hour or 45 minutes. Being in the sun, talking with other people, does wonders for keeping my mental health in check.

* why could you contribute to the team?
given the vast knowledge I have and had collected in all my 6 years as an undergrad particularly with regards to using AI/ML technolgoies I think I can share this knowledge I have to my fellow coworkers, but apart from this I like to think of myself as collaboratvie and encouraging in that if I see my fellow coworker struggling with their task I'd want to guide them through it and sit there with them to see perhaps the error through and share what i can in order for them to solve their problem at hand.  


# Datung
* solving credit problem in small businesses to increase capital of small business to grwo more as a business
* other banks don't lend capital or loans to small businesses and datung solves that
* work with small businesses like cash only business. Manuyal ledgers nila and they need to find a way to verify it, using computer vision.
* see if the client is a good payer
* this is interesting kasi were using computer vision to determine whether a clients manually encoded ledger is someone worthy ot be lent a loan.
* An accounting ledger is basically an account or record used to store bookkeeping entries for balance-sheet and income-statement transactions. Accounting ledger journal entries can include accounts like cash, accounts receivable, investments, inventory, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and customer deposits. So it can be determined if a customer is trustworthy not only worthy of being lent a loan is if nagbabayad naman siya on time sa mga utang niya, if madalas nga ba siya magbayad on time, etc.
maganda to kaso sa paranaque nga lang
* maaayos yung CEO, they work as a team, close knit, marami lang responsibilities. I'm thankful for the assurance that it's okay to ask for help because I will not know what I'm doing I will not know the outcome, but I'm willing to fail trying.

* magkakaroon naman ng office in 1 year time, and they expect me to stay for the long term. Kung okay naman ang pay and naggrow ang experience in various technologies then its a good offer for me. Their website upon first glance tells me their good at what they do.


How can I leverage an individuals manually encoded accounting ledger that details their businesses cash flow, how much they are making, losing, as a dataset that tells me whether they are worthy of being lent a loan? What variables can be possibly used for a predictive model to use to predict whether form this individuals ledger can he be worthy of borrowing a loan?



Leveraging a manually encoded accounting ledger for loanworthiness assessment requires careful extraction and transformation of data into usable variables. Here's a breakdown of how you can approach this, along with potential variables for a predictive model:

1. Data Extraction and Cleaning:

Digitization:
If the ledger is handwritten, you'll need to digitize it. This could involve manual data entry, OCR (Optical Character Recognition) if the handwriting is clear, or a combination of both.
Ensure accuracy during digitization. Double-check entries, especially numerical values.
Data Structuring:
Transform the ledger into a structured format like a CSV or Excel file.
Standardize date formats, currency symbols, and descriptions.
Categorize transactions into meaningful categories (e.g., sales revenue, expenses, loan repayments, etc.).
Data Cleaning:
Handle missing values. You might impute them based on averages or trends, or exclude records with excessive missing data.
Identify and correct outliers. These could be errors or genuine, but unusual, transactions.
Ensure consistency in transaction descriptions.
2. Variable Creation:

Here are potential variables you can derive from the ledger for a predictive model:

Cash Flow Related:
Average Monthly Cash Flow: Calculate the average net cash flow (inflows minus outflows) over a specific period (e.g., 6 months, 1 year).
Cash Flow Volatility: Measure the standard deviation or variance of monthly cash flow to assess stability.
Cash Flow Trends: Identify upward or downward trends in cash flow over time.
Days Cash on Hand: calculate how many days the business can operate with its current cash on hand.
Frequency of negative cash flow: How often does the business run out of money.
Revenue and Expense Related:
Average Monthly Revenue: Calculate the average monthly income.
Average Monthly Expenses: Calculate the average monthly expenditures.
Profit Margin: Calculate the profit margin (net profit/revenue).
Expense Ratio: Calculate the ratio of expenses to revenue.
Revenue growth rate: percentage of growth in revenue over a given period.
Debt and Liabilities:
Existing Debt: If the ledger includes loan repayments, you can infer existing debt levels.
Debt-to-Income Ratio: Calculate the ratio of debt repayments to income.
Frequency of loan or debt payments.
Operational Metrics:
Transaction Frequency: The number of transactions per month can indicate business activity.
Customer Concentration: If the ledger reveals customer details, analyze the distribution of revenue across customers. High concentration might indicate risk.
Supplier Concentration: Similar to customer concentration, high dependence on a single supplier can be a risk.
Time-Based Variables:
Business Operating History: The length of time the business has been operating.
Seasonality: Identify seasonal patterns in cash flow or revenue.
3. Predictive Modeling:

Model Selection:
Consider logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting models.
The choice depends on the size of the dataset and the complexity of the relationships between variables.
Feature Engineering:
Combine or transform existing variables to create new, more informative features.
Use techniques like polynomial features or interaction terms.
Model Training and Evaluation:
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train the model on the training set.
Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.   
Risk Scoring: create a risk score based upon the output of the model.
4. Considerations:

Data Quality: The accuracy of the model heavily relies on the quality of the ledger data.
Subjectivity: Manual encoding can introduce subjectivity.
Data Limitations: A single ledger might not capture all aspects of the business's financial health.
Legal and Ethical Issues: Ensure compliance with data privacy regulations.
Contextual Understanding: It is very important to try and understand the context of the business. For example, large purchases of equipment would be large outflows, but are not necessarily a sign of a bad business.
Verification: Whenever possible, verify information in the ledger with external sources (e.g., bank statements, invoices).
By following these steps, you can effectively leverage an individual's manually encoded accounting ledger to build a predictive model for loanworthiness assessment.

Engineered Variables:
```

Based on this sample ledger, here are examples of variables you can engineer for your predictive model:

1. Cash Flow Variables:

Average Monthly Net Cash Flow:
Calculate the net cash flow (Inflow - Outflow) for each month.
Average these monthly net cash flows.
Example: (720 + 860) / 2 = 790.
Monthly Cash Flow Volatility:
Calculate the standard deviation of monthly net cash flows.
This measures the fluctuation in cash flow.
Number of Negative Cash Flow Months:
Count the number of months where net cash flow is negative.
Minimum Monthly Balance:
Find the lowest balance that occured within the month.
Days Cash on Hand (estimated):
Divide the current balance by the average daily outflow.
Cash Flow Trend:
Calculate the change in average cash flow over time (e.g., compare the last 3 months to the previous 3 months).
2. Revenue and Expense Variables:

Average Monthly Revenue:
Sum the "Inflow" values for each month and calculate the average.
Example: (1700 + 2000) / 2 = 1850.
Average Monthly Expenses:
Sum the "Outflow" values (excluding "Personal" and "Opening/Closing Balance") for each month and calculate the average.
Example: (980 + 1140) / 2 = 1060.
Profit Margin (Monthly):
(Monthly Revenue - Monthly Expenses) / Monthly Revenue.
Expense Ratio (Monthly):
Monthly Expenses / Monthly Revenue.
Sales Variability:
Standard deviation of monthly sales revenue.
Expense Variability:
Standard deviation of monthly expenses.
3. Debt and Liabilities Variables:

Average Monthly Loan Repayment:
Sum the "Outflow" values where "Category" is "Debt" and calculate the average.
Debt-to-Cash Flow Ratio:
Average Monthly Loan Repayment / Average Monthly Net Cash Flow.
Debt Payment Frequency:
How often debt payments are made.
4. Operational Variables:

Transaction Frequency (Monthly):
Count the number of transactions per month.
Owner's Draw Frequency and Amount:
Frequency and average amount of withdrawals.
5. Time-Based Variables:

Months of Operation:
Calculate the number of months the ledger covers.
Seasonality Indicators:
If you have more data, you could identify seasonal patterns in sales or expenses.
How to Use the Variables:

Create a table: Organize the calculated variables into a table, with each row representing a month or a summary of the ledger.
Add target variable: Add a column representing the target variable (e.g., "Loan Default" - 1 for default, 0 for no default). This will need to come from external data, such as a history of loan payments.
Train your model: Use the engineered variables as features to train your predictive model.
Important Notes:

The quality of the ledger data is crucial.
These are just examples; you can engineer more variables based on the specific needs of your model.
Always consider the context of the business when analyzing the data.
External data is important. The ledger alone will not provide a target variable for training a predictive model.
