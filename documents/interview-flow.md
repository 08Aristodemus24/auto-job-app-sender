interviewer descrbes workflow and technologies
- web scraping
- data orchestration
- ml they use pub/sub I can relate with this
- I currently had experience with RAG agetns at my current internship
- salina is cool, this ml can take in fiels and interpet it
transcription using whisper X from audio/video, speech to text AI, can chapterize and summarize submitted video/audio

they'll list the technologies they use, some of it you have experience and some of it you won't list those as your strengths and weaknesses
strengths:
python
web scraping
node.js
in db management usually download mo yung management system like mongo db compass for mongo db, pgadmin 4 for postgresql, or mysql workbench for mysql, add to path the bin folder for accessible commands in command line, create instance in cloud or management system application itself and then save the insances credentials this will be the URI you will need with hostname and password you will need to connect to the instance, then we connect to the db via this instance

weaknesses:
redis 
etl
apache airflow
aws
azure
docker/containerization
separate my code based on functionality like django with apps, urls, settings
basically I should've separated the UI from the insertion of the reading of data and insertion of said data to db
use try catch block for potential errors in database transactions
try to write utilities.py that contains all helper functions
replace index.py with a more udnerstandable one where the name of the file represents what happens in the source code itself
naubusan lang ako oras pero important rin may comments, lagyan ng type ang mga arguments

employer will describe their worflow:
automatic web scraper, SQL, 
orchestrate
transform data
pass transformed data to ml model (salina) to train
proof of concept (venn diagram) -> prototype code -> execution

## Final interview might consist of the common...

### Why do you want to work here?
I think the idea of collecting and operating on large swathes of data
and using data from news articles, technological trends, medical data to allow other clients
to make their own decisions based on the data we could process for them really caught my eye
because in all honesty I'm just someone who's fond of doing so and i think doing it on the job will be a
great learning experience 

### Why should we hire you?
In all humility apart from obvious skills, I draw from my personal experience of quite frankly being always a lone developer
if there is such a term, and if I'm given the opportunity here to collaborate with a team of like minded individuals someone as wanting to grow just as much as me, and wanting to contribute just as much as me, I'll be driven to do my best to give back to this organization by doing my due diligence to always committing to the tasks at hand 

### Describing their workflow:
* ung meron naman impediments like yung siguro nahihirapan sa tasks ganun kilangan iresolve kasi every week dapat may milestone na natatapos
* they use agile methodology to develop applications, scrum to be specific. 2 - 4 weeks sprints. After these 2 or 4 weeks may natatapos na na feature ng application or nakapagpush na sa dev then into production branch. As a result some tools you really need to learn are docker for containerization, pulling from development branch and then merging in this branch
* product backlog - list of tasks for all sprints
* sprint backlog - specific tasks in the product backlog for a specific sprint lasting 1 to 4 weeks. E.g. for week 1 these are the tasks
* after completing tasks in the sprint after say 1 week there will be a presentation of your work to your colleagues



# GCash

# Xurpas Enterprise, Inc.
* what are 3 main you'd want to resign. Work culture, or if meron toxicity in the workplace, micro management
* what is python?
* when is try except used?
* tell me about yourself. The answer here is not describing what your hobbies are, not your age, gender, or location, but your work experience an example can be the ff.

I was/am a data engineer intern at my previous company virtuals protocol where I've mainly used python as a programming language and libraries like pandas, numpy, tesseract, to clean and preprocess datasets for RAG AI agents or retrieval augmented generation AI agents. These preprocessed datasets coming from raw ones like pdfs, images, spreadsheets, jsons, word documents are then ingested by the AI agent to fine tune its knowledge base. This helps increase its market capital as an agent operating in environments like twitter in a purely automated fashion to engage users and have those users invest in it thus increasing capital.

my background is computer science where I've been for the last 6 years of my study learning all that I can about machine learning and deep learning and artificial intelligence using primarily python as a language and vast frameworks made for ML/AI like tensorflow, pytorch, numpy, pandas to build many of the projects I have revolving around AI/ML and more recently Data Engineering/ETL pipelines for seamless AI/ML model training.

[describe one of your personal projects or more accurately your dissertation which focuses on identifying noise/interferences in electrodermal activity signals recorded from human beings, this is to remove eventually these interferences and be able to use the cleaned signals for various medical tasks like stress detection or arousal detection]

This was the main specialization I chose given not only the rising trend with it but also by virtue of it capturing my interest because I thought AI could be healthcare one of my main shall we say advocacies that I'd like to partake in in the future/

in between my junior and senior year and even after I built more of the aforementioned personal projects and sought internships that honed my skills further in data preprocessing, data cleaning. One of my colleagues who I'd consider a prominent figure in the Philippine AI/ML tech space is theo ne that recruited me to the data engineerign role I interned for (Armielyn Obinguar).

* what do you do to manage stress?
I go outside, exercise and just try not to think about my work for a menial 1 hour or 45 minutes. Being in the sun, talking with other people, does wonders for keeping my mental health in check.

* why could you contribute to the team?
given the vast knowledge I have and had collected in all my 6 years as an undergrad particularly with regards to using AI/ML technolgoies I think I can share this knowledge I have to my fellow coworkers, but apart from this I like to think of myself as collaboratvie and encouraging in that if I see my fellow coworker struggling with their task I'd want to guide them through it and sit there with them to see perhaps the error through and share what i can in order for them to solve their problem at hand.  


# Datung
* solving credit problem in small businesses to increase capital of small business to grwo more as a business
* other banks don't lend capital or loans to small businesses and datung solves that
* work with small businesses like cash only business. Manuyal ledgers nila and they need to find a way to verify it, using computer vision.
* see if the client is a good payer
* this is interesting kasi were using computer vision to determine whether a clients manually encoded ledger is someone worthy ot be lent a loan.
* An accounting ledger is basically an account or record used to store bookkeeping entries for balance-sheet and income-statement transactions. Accounting ledger journal entries can include accounts like cash, accounts receivable, investments, inventory, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and customer deposits. So it can be determined if a customer is trustworthy not only worthy of being lent a loan is if nagbabayad naman siya on time sa mga utang niya, if madalas nga ba siya magbayad on time, etc.
maganda to kaso sa paranaque nga lang
* maaayos yung CEO, they work as a team, close knit, marami lang responsibilities. I'm thankful for the assurance that it's okay to ask for help because I will not know what I'm doing I will not know the outcome, but I'm willing to fail trying.
* Automated Credit Scoring

How can I leverage an individuals manually encoded accounting ledger that details their businesses cash flow, how much they are making, losing, as a dataset that tells me whether they are worthy of being lent a loan? What variables can be possibly used for a predictive model to use to predict whether form this individuals ledger can he be worthy of borrowing a loan?



Leveraging a manually encoded accounting ledger for loanworthiness assessment requires careful extraction and transformation of data into usable variables. Here's a breakdown of how you can approach this, along with potential variables for a predictive model:

1. Data Extraction and Cleaning:

Digitization:
If the ledger is handwritten, you'll need to digitize it. This could involve manual data entry, OCR (Optical Character Recognition) if the handwriting is clear, or a combination of both.
Ensure accuracy during digitization. Double-check entries, especially numerical values.
Data Structuring:
Transform the ledger into a structured format like a CSV or Excel file.
Standardize date formats, currency symbols, and descriptions.
Categorize transactions into meaningful categories (e.g., sales revenue, expenses, loan repayments, etc.).
Data Cleaning:
Handle missing values. You might impute them based on averages or trends, or exclude records with excessive missing data.
Identify and correct outliers. These could be errors or genuine, but unusual, transactions.
Ensure consistency in transaction descriptions.
2. Variable Creation:

Here are potential variables you can derive from the ledger for a predictive model:

Cash Flow Related:
Average Monthly Cash Flow: Calculate the average net cash flow (inflows minus outflows) over a specific period (e.g., 6 months, 1 year).
Cash Flow Volatility: Measure the standard deviation or variance of monthly cash flow to assess stability.
Cash Flow Trends: Identify upward or downward trends in cash flow over time.
Days Cash on Hand: calculate how many days the business can operate with its current cash on hand.
Frequency of negative cash flow: How often does the business run out of money.
Revenue and Expense Related:
Average Monthly Revenue: Calculate the average monthly income.
Average Monthly Expenses: Calculate the average monthly expenditures.
Profit Margin: Calculate the profit margin (net profit/revenue).
Expense Ratio: Calculate the ratio of expenses to revenue.
Revenue growth rate: percentage of growth in revenue over a given period.
Debt and Liabilities:
Existing Debt: If the ledger includes loan repayments, you can infer existing debt levels.
Debt-to-Income Ratio: Calculate the ratio of debt repayments to income.
Frequency of loan or debt payments.
Operational Metrics:
Transaction Frequency: The number of transactions per month can indicate business activity.
Customer Concentration: If the ledger reveals customer details, analyze the distribution of revenue across customers. High concentration might indicate risk.
Supplier Concentration: Similar to customer concentration, high dependence on a single supplier can be a risk.
Time-Based Variables:
Business Operating History: The length of time the business has been operating.
Seasonality: Identify seasonal patterns in cash flow or revenue.
3. Predictive Modeling:

Model Selection:
Consider logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting models.
The choice depends on the size of the dataset and the complexity of the relationships between variables.
Feature Engineering:
Combine or transform existing variables to create new, more informative features.
Use techniques like polynomial features or interaction terms.
Model Training and Evaluation:
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train the model on the training set.
Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.   
Risk Scoring: create a risk score based upon the output of the model.
4. Considerations:

Data Quality: The accuracy of the model heavily relies on the quality of the ledger data.
Subjectivity: Manual encoding can introduce subjectivity.
Data Limitations: A single ledger might not capture all aspects of the business's financial health.
Legal and Ethical Issues: Ensure compliance with data privacy regulations.
Contextual Understanding: It is very important to try and understand the context of the business. For example, large purchases of equipment would be large outflows, but are not necessarily a sign of a bad business.
Verification: Whenever possible, verify information in the ledger with external sources (e.g., bank statements, invoices).
By following these steps, you can effectively leverage an individual's manually encoded accounting ledger to build a predictive model for loanworthiness assessment.

can you give me a sample ledger and sample variables you can engineer or use for a predictive model?

Engineered Variables:
```

Based on this sample ledger, here are examples of variables you can engineer for your predictive model:

1. Cash Flow Variables:

Average Monthly Net Cash Flow:
Calculate the net cash flow (Inflow - Outflow) for each month.
Average these monthly net cash flows.
Example: (720 + 860) / 2 = 790.
Monthly Cash Flow Volatility:
Calculate the standard deviation of monthly net cash flows.
This measures the fluctuation in cash flow.
Number of Negative Cash Flow Months:
Count the number of months where net cash flow is negative.
Minimum Monthly Balance:
Find the lowest balance that occured within the month.
Days Cash on Hand (estimated):
Divide the current balance by the average daily outflow.
Cash Flow Trend:
Calculate the change in average cash flow over time (e.g., compare the last 3 months to the previous 3 months).
2. Revenue and Expense Variables:

Average Monthly Revenue:
Sum the "Inflow" values for each month and calculate the average.
Example: (1700 + 2000) / 2 = 1850.
Average Monthly Expenses:
Sum the "Outflow" values (excluding "Personal" and "Opening/Closing Balance") for each month and calculate the average.
Example: (980 + 1140) / 2 = 1060.
Profit Margin (Monthly):
(Monthly Revenue - Monthly Expenses) / Monthly Revenue.
Expense Ratio (Monthly):
Monthly Expenses / Monthly Revenue.
Sales Variability:
Standard deviation of monthly sales revenue.
Expense Variability:
Standard deviation of monthly expenses.
3. Debt and Liabilities Variables:

Average Monthly Loan Repayment:
Sum the "Outflow" values where "Category" is "Debt" and calculate the average.
Debt-to-Cash Flow Ratio:
Average Monthly Loan Repayment / Average Monthly Net Cash Flow.
Debt Payment Frequency:
How often debt payments are made.
4. Operational Variables:

Transaction Frequency (Monthly):
Count the number of transactions per month.
Owner's Draw Frequency and Amount:
Frequency and average amount of withdrawals.
5. Time-Based Variables:

Months of Operation:
Calculate the number of months the ledger covers.
Seasonality Indicators:
If you have more data, you could identify seasonal patterns in sales or expenses.
How to Use the Variables:

Create a table: Organize the calculated variables into a table, with each row representing a month or a summary of the ledger.
Add target variable: Add a column representing the target variable (e.g., "Loan Default" - 1 for default, 0 for no default). This will need to come from external data, such as a history of loan payments.
Train your model: Use the engineered variables as features to train your predictive model.
Important Notes:

The quality of the ledger data is crucial.
These are just examples; you can engineer more variables based on the specific needs of your model.
Always consider the context of the business when analyzing the data.
External data is important. The ledger alone will not provide a target variable for training a predictive model.

# Azeus Systems LTd.
## Behavioral Questions:
* what qualities are you trying to find in a company? `open honest communication, mutual support, responsibility and integrity `

* what are your 3 biggest strengths and explain each one? 
- `meticulousness: as I always make sure to analyze the quality of the code I write and make sure most if not every case is taken into consideration`
- `creativity: I really like to implement designs in code that elicit beauty and inspiration`
- `collaboration: I like to share my thoughts of approaching a problem with my teammates and asking in turn their opinion on how they would solve it, and sharing our solutions right after and come to a reasonable way how to integrate it`

* what are your weakness as a person and as a worker/student and how did you confront them? `sometimes I tend to keep problems (both technical and non-technical) to myself, and while independence has its merits it means that I lead myself at times to unnecessary amounts stress, so I always make sure to understand the problem clearly by asking my colleagues and then ask without shame help if needed`

* what are you trying to avoid when working (they give work life balance kaya answer you don't want to burn out well not explicitly but as much as possible you try to avoid enough work and then balance with it other endeavors)? `I know I'm a young developer I have much to learn and naturally that may come out in trying to take on as much responsibility as physically possible as a way to learn and prove myself, so I avoid biting off more than I can chew because I've learned that everything can just be taken one step at a time as opposed to all at once at the cost of being burnt out in long run`

* how do you manage your time and schedule? `I find that in the context of work I write down the task what this task requires what other requirements those requirements require, and see the simplest task/requirement I can accomplish this way I manage my time by not procrastinating through being overwhelmed at the task given. I make sure to also do my routine like eating, sleeping, taking little breaks here and there in an orderly manner so as to keep my schedule and time on track.`

* were there times that you had to choose schoolworks over personal events? ``

* What were the results of your 3 strengths in thesis? 
- `meticulousness: I made sure the signal features we had were properly extracted and through the functions we wrote, we made sure to understand the dataset fully in order to implement the features needed for our system to train on`
- `creativity: the user interface is something I'm most proud of because of its ability to be simple but also functional and informative, the design is also something I'm most proud of as it elicits the paradigm of minimalism in something as complex a system as ours`
- `collaboration: me and my group mates had our strengths in doing other aspects of our thesis, but one aspect was really challenging in that we had no adequate resources to train our system using our large dataset. I offered solutions to avail computing resources from providers like google to my groupmates but with mutual effort in researching other means my other groupmate offered to instead avail computing resources from DOST which was luckily completely free of charge, and luckily could be used using a Linux OS which I was already familiar with, allowing us to train our system without much hassle from cost and most especially not having a large learning curve to use the resource`

* what are the programming languages you're familiar and proficient in? `Python, JavaScript, SQL, C++`

* what to do when having conflicting ideas with other members? 
```
1. know the idea I have in mind and want implemented 
2. know the idea my team member personally wants to implement
3. assess the strengths and weaknesses of each idea
4. it is at times unavoidable that he/she will have the better solution and so sometimes you have to put your ego aside but sometimes I reasonable integration of both ideas strengths can be in fact better as it not only maybe a better solution but both parties can be mutually satisified. (You can both have your cake and eat it too so to speak)
```

* what's your salary expectation
`I've researched and seen the typical salary range of mid level software developers and engineers in this company amid my application and the range is between the lower range of 250k/year to 500k/year or 20800/month to 41700/month, so the number I'm comfortable with would be 30000/month based on my current knowledge and expertise does that fit into the company budget? But I'd like to learn more about the specific technologies tailored for this position as that will determine further my expectations for my salary.`

* what kind of personality you like to work with?
* what are the types of people you don't want to work with?


* tell me about yourself: 
- `I was a data engineer intern at virtuals protocol where I mostly cleaned, preprocessed mostly stock data for fine tuning Retrieval Augmented Generation AI agents`
- `I took Computer Science in the Polytechnic University of the Philippines where I picked up in part most of my skills in software development & data science and now more personally to data analytics`
- `in my time during and after college I made personal projects mostly revolving around machine learning integrated with fullstack web frameworks learning a ton about how typical machine learning projects work and how each step like preprocessing, deploymnet, and testing works under the hood.`
- `outside of work I've really been fond of creating personal projects more geared in data analytics and using tools like python, SQL, powerbi to transform data and visualize it using dashboards`
- `all in all I'm just really looking for an opportunity to use the skills I have now in data science and full stakc development and translate it to the workplace where I can continually grow`

* why should we hire you (more selfish reasons)?
apart from the technical skills

* why do you want to work here?
`Having first learned about your company 2 years ago what I really value is that your compnay strives for the virtues of responsibility, teamwork, and honesty, which resonate with me because I believe I can be responsible enough to own my shortcomings, support my teammates by listening to their concerns and questions, and be completely honest about certain predicaments I may be in, or concerns I have without fear of ridicule or shame. I think these are essential in the workplace which funnily enough can be translated into human to human relationships themselves be it platonic or romantic.`

`I think the company fosters growth in technologies which I'm greatly enthusiastic about, because while monetary value is important we cannot deny this, learning new things is just as equally important and I think learning new things like technologies can greatly contribute to developing quality products. On a more simple note learning new things is fun for me personally and learning new things through hands on building is what I'm fond of doing the most`

## TEchnical Coding Interview Questions:
1. FIzzBuzz variation question from Leetcode 
2. Simple mathematics and logic question 
3. Maximum subarray sum from Leetcode (uses kadanes algorithm) `done practicing`
4. Print an hourglass (according to their hourglass pattern) `done practicing`
5. Given two arrays, one which is rotated (either left or right), find the least times of rotations of the un-rotated array to match the rotated one.

## Behavioral Questions:


# Xpress
## Values:
The organizational culture at XPRESS is dynamic, with a strong emphasis on collaboration and resource accessibility, which supports a productive work environment. However, the company faces challenges such as high turnover and a lack of remote work flexibility. Management practices often lean towards micromanagement, and there are noticeable gaps in cultural sensitivity, particularly regarding local customs and holidays. These issues can impact employee morale and the overall workplace atmosphere.

# Cebuana Lhuillier
* salary range is around 
do you have any more questions for us?
- "how's it like working there?"
- "I really learned alot from the company but I'm curious would there be some advice or feedback you could give for applicants such as myself on what I could improve more on should I potentially have a chance to work here?"

# Accenture
* salar yrange for ASWE is 20000 to 25000 per month


# Plan
* eo basically even a junior data analyst role is so saturated with competition because its the only entry level data role. No one is hiring emtry level data engineers and machine learning engineer or ai developers if anyone gets hired for it out of college they are already the exceptions the superstars the ones who were lucky enough to learn data at a quick level and who had enough connections for someone to take them under their wing and evntualy get opportunities to train and then have that data role. Pero ikaw you're a statistic, you're just like anybody else na kumakayod, you're not special, you're not a quick learner, you don't have many connections for referrals. you are starting at the bottom of the barrel and you wont have any chamce at someone spoonfeeding you like those lucky bastards. You're going to have to start at the very bottom like a junior financial analyst, junior sales operations analyst, 
and then once in you can leverage your python, sql, powerbi skills to automate what is supposed to be a "manual" job, you can use your data skills to automate these things and thereby gain domain knowledge especially financial or sales or healthcare knowledge and domain knowledge combined with tools you've used that wasn't even oart of the job description in your resume when your finding your next job will be unbelievably powerful

For me because mas viable ang junior data analyst or junioro data scientist para sa experience ko mea ning I cannot enter into ml engineering or data engineering head first kilangan talagang yung former munan mga roles

look up company's people on linked in
if < 20 often the CEO will be interviewing and hiring for a position
if 20 - 100 often the vp of engineering or chief tech. officer
if > 100 it will be the IT director, data director or a similar director baesd on the role/field your getting into

don't try to apply for job boards and then send a cold email saying you've applied to them (kaya lang contradictory kasi other people will say after online applying you should reach out to the recruiter or hiring manager)

## Government Owned and Controlled Corporations Advantages & Disadvantages
Pros:
* If you get yourself promoted to a casual or permanent position, madami benifits. From mid-year and end of the year bonuses, uniform allowance, misc. allowances and incentives, GSIS, PhilHealth etc.
* Relaxed environment(or at least where I am working at). The job is easy, but very unfulfilling and boring. I can "destress" browsing reddit, listen to music, etc.
* Madali mag pa approve ng leaves(VL or SL) and generous sila mag bigay ng leaves. I think I already used up more than half of my 20/year VLs. You also get 5 days MANDATORY vacation leave(deducted from VL), and 3 special privilege leave(not deducted from VL or SL).
* If your boss is generous he'll give you some of that "ayuda" that he got from contractors.
* Stability. Whatever happens: typhoons, pandemic, natural disasters, etc.. (with the exception of war/invasion I guess), you'll still get your salary in full.
* Good retirement package. Monthly pensions for retirees in the gov't is based on the last 3 years' monthly salary. So let's say you managed to get 90k/month, more or less that'll be your monthly pension until you die.
* You have an opportunity to connect with or become one of the "people in high places".
* I'm handling a digitization project of our LGU and I have full autonomy regarding the project. I decide on everything from what tech stack to use up to deployment dates. What's important is it follows the relevant laws and it's IRR.
* You can take paid trainings, as well as scholarships to further your education. And afaik, this have no bond.
* You virtually have unlimited budget to use for the project at your disposal, as long as you can properly justify it to the internal budget committee and COA.
* It's not working at a government position that's a career suicide. It's being stagnant working at the same position be it government or not. You could say the same if I applied for an entry level job at a private company and stayed there for my entire career.
* Working in the government is the fastest route to get formal experience which you can use to hop to better jobs. Plus, if you are assigned on system maintenance, that opens up opportunity to upskill while being paid and earning experience for your next job. It's a win.

Cons:
* Data Analyst BUT iba ginagawa ko comapred sa job title. I'm a tech support, programmer, data encoder (you could probably automate this with python) in one. I don't do any data analytics or anything close to my job description.
* Most IT positions in government offices are dead-end jobs. Wala career growth, di ka magiging head ng IT unit.
* Most agencies/offices don't have an independent IT unit. IT Staff will be attached to the office of the agency's head. Kaya yun marami paper trail para lang maapprove IT related stuff.
* If ikaw lang programmer, wala ka matutunan sa seniors mo since glorified clerks/admin aide lang sila.
* IT personnel's equipment is on the low list of priorities. Unless laptop ng boss yan na gaming shit laptop worth 60k-150k pero pang eexcel lang syempre approved agad yan or unless may memo galing central office.
* Technologically illerate co-workers specially bosses. Dito ka maiirita, simple problem like no power sa monitor or during video cons(google meet/zoom), need nila ikaw pa gagawa ng link. Need mo pa sila bantayan during video cons and ikaw taga mute and unmute pag di mo ma unmute on time, magagalit yung boomer boss mo.
* Anything that went wrong with office IT equipment, sigurado IT Staff agad may kasalanan. Na ransomware buong office kasi yung bobong mong boss/co-worker nag open ng email and file na may ransomware? Ikaw may kasalanan.
* IT contingency planning and risk reduction doesn't exist. Our server is sitting at an old unused office room that's very dusty(yikes a big fire hazard). That's why I do my own database backups.
* You'll see how corrupt a government office is. It will drain your soul and love for country.
* I'm upskilling myself right now so I can transfer to the private sector.



-Government if you want a relaxed, okay pay, low risks, low rewards job.
-Private if you want career growth and a fulfilling career that is high in rewards, and high in risks.

recommended if you go for DICT or DOST

# Upskilling
* essentially the MS PL-300 PowerBI data analyst certification and the MS DP-300 Azure DBA certification then a AWS Cloud Practitioner certification then a AWS Solutions Architect Associate certification then finally to a AWS Data Engineer Associate certification is what will lead me to eventually become a data engineer 

and for that I need to respectively sign up for these courses in order to pass the certification exams

- Microsoft PowerBI data analyst professional certificate course
The main thing that inspired me to do this course was to learn PowerBI and learn to create beautiful dashboards with the data I have and use it as a representation of my analysis. Because in my mind I could use this learning to do a project that would help me learn further and prepare eventually for an entry level Data Analyst role, and well you know because recently I've taken a liking to analyzing data using tools like SQL and now PowerBI, an interest unbeknownst to me before had I otherwise took up the decision to try data analytics. But here I am now looking to develop my skills in creating dashboards and especially learning how to model data as I plan to use it eventually in the field of data engineering. Maybe I'm no stranger to data as of today because I've come to be acquainted with it already during days when I was fond of (although I still am) building machine learning and deep learning models. But like all new things I'm glad I took up those foundations so that I can use it to learn new things/technologies here here. Fun fact about myself is that if I wasn't in computer science or in tech I'd probably be in healthcare, but lo and behold you can use tech for healthcare so I'm quite excited to use the  skills I gain here eventually in the field of health and wellness.

- a course on the dp300 azure dba certification 

this is for the phase of being a data analyst, but for the phase of now stepping into data engineering we need...

- a course on aws cloud practitioner certification
- course on aws solutions architect certification 
- course on aws data engineer certification 

### Applying for financial aid:
I am quite frankly still a student trying to build his way into having a better career in data engineering which I know will help my prospects in the future, and I firmly believe that this course on data engineering will help me so much in ways that I can use for the industry I am to endeavor in which is hopefully in this industry applied to business, or at the least an entry level role in it. I am applying for a financial aid because given my current situation I cannot at the moment being an unemployed student be able to pay for these tremendously helpful resources, and I hope I can benefit still from these resources given my situation. And I hope to repay this debt in whatever way I can given that it has helped me as I said in more ways than I can describe, and I hope that by providing me with the necessary resources to help me build my future prospects I can one day hopefully repay everything I owe that helped me get where I am now.

Currently because I'm am trying my absolute best and doing what I can to land at least an opportunity if not an entry level job in the data industry together, I firmly believe that this specific course will help me do my job intuitively in the future hopefully, which I know can give me the edge over other potential competitors and applicants in the data industry in my country. Given that I've tasted but a small aspect of the instructors at Microsoft way of teaching I genuinely believe that in learning specialization courses like this one, I can better have the skills especially the foundational skills in doing my Job more efficiently and again intuitively in the future, and moreover be a better and more productive person given the deep understanding that this course I believe offers genuinely, which I can not only use in my potential opportunities in the future but in venturing into starting my own business as well with the knowledge this has taught, teaches, and will teach me
