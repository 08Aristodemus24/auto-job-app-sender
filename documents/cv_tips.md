I read your comment also sir sa post ko po with regards to showing more numbers. I just didn't have an idea whether nakasave ng x amount of money yung for example the automation scripts I wrote for the internship I had, so ano po pwede lagay nalang as alternative in cases like these?

If iko-compare mo yung manual process sa automated process
ilan ang mase-save mong time
or ilang % mas efficient yung process because of that
orâ€¦ if wala ka naman mapagko-compare-an
estimate mo if ilang hours ang ni-run ng automation mo
for example, nagra-run ng 10 mins a day yung automation
so, multiply mo yung ng ilang days and months sya nag-run
then yun pwede mo ilagay ang x number of hours automated
pero kung mapag-ko-compare-an ka ng numbers na manual vs automated, mas maganda
regarding naman sa money saved
madali na lang yun if may hours ka na ng automated hours
bale ang gagawi mo is e-estimate ka ulit ng cost
for example, ang isang entry level na employee, kaya nya yung manual na ginagawa ng automation
so, say P25,000 per month ang sahod nun

so, P156 per hour ang cost nun.
then multiply mo sa number of hours na gagawin sya nang manual
yun magigung estimated savings mo
then convert mo sya into annual savings
